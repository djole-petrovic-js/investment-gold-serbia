    "Highlighted-ThirdParagraph": "Recognizable all over the world.",
    "WhyCoins": "Why coins?",
    "Main-FirstParagraph": "Due to their quality of workmanship, and the reputation of the producers, the coins are recognized all over the world, and are easily bought and sold, both by large and small investment gold dealers. Mainly because of their quality and aesthetics, they are more expensive than bullion, so the difference in selling and buying price is bigger.",
    "Main-SecondParagraph": "Coins issued by central banks of sovereign states are legal tender in that country. The coins have a nominal value expressed in the current currency. For example. Philhamronia 1 ounce 100 euros, golden eagle 100 dollars, etc. Coins are therefore protected by the same laws that protect paper money. Therefore, the consequences of counterfeiting are significantly greater. In this regard, coins have been acquiring strong security features for years since they were produced, such as serrated edges. Today, there are even stronger, more modern measures, for example the Britannia hologram padlock, the Canadian maple leaf has a microtext on the coin itself, etc.",
    "Main-ThirdParagraph": "They have been produced for many years, e.g. South African Krugerrand since 1967, which makes them recognizable, easy to test, and therefore easy to invest. Since they have been produced for a long time under the same standards, the integrity of all coins has been preserved, so it is easy to determine the validity.",

    "Highlighted-ThirdParagraph": "Various types of manufacturers.",
    "WhyGoldBars": "Why bars?",
    "Main-FirstParagraph": "The so-called 'assay' packages are ideal for storing gold bars, because the gold in them is hermetically sealed and completely protected from scratches, bumps, fingerprints, etc. Thanks to modern technologies for testing the authenticity of metals, the gold in such packages is easy to test and determine that it is real.",
    "Main-SecondParagraph": "Due to the simplicity of production, bars are somewhat cheaper than coins, so they represent perhaps a more efficient way to buy a larger amount of gold. Also, the difference between the purchase and sale price (spread) is also smaller, which makes them suitable for investment.",
    "Main-ThirdParagraph": "Bullion from both sovereign and private mints is sold on the market. Unlike coins, sizes larger than one ounce are also sold, e.g. a gold bar of 100 grams, and even one kilogram.",
